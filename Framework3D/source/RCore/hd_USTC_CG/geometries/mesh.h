///
/// This class is an example of a Hydra Rprim, or renderable object, and it
/// gets created on a call to HdRenderIndex::InsertRprim() with a type of
/// HdPrimTypeTokens->mesh.
///
/// The prim object's main function is to bridge the scene description and the
/// renderable representation. The Hydra image generation algorithm will call
/// HdRenderIndex::SyncAll() before any drawing; this, in turn, will call
/// Sync() for each mesh with new data.
///
/// Sync() is passed a set of dirtyBits, indicating which scene buffers are
/// dirty. It uses these to pull all of the new scene data and constructs
/// updated geometry objects.
///
/// An rprim's state is lazily populated in Sync(); matching this, Finalize()
/// can do the heavy work of releasing state (such as handles into the top-level
/// scene), so that object population and existence aren't tied to each other.
